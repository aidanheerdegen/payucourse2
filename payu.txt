What is Payu?
=============

Payu is a python based "scientific workflow manager"

Huh?
----------

That means it runs your model for you. in short:

* Setup model run directory
* Run the model
* Move outputs/restarts to an archive directory
* Clean up the run directory
* Run again (if instructed to do so)
  

Using Payu
==========

Using an experiment
-------------------

(Recap from last week)

Clone an existing experiment (usually in ``$HOME``):

.. code:: sh

   cd $HOME
   mkdir -p mom
   cd mom
   git clone /short/public/mxw900/payucourse/expt/bowl1

This is the "*control directory*" for ``bowl1``


Run the experiment
------------------

Use the system payu::

   module load payu/0.9.2

This job is pre-configured, run it!

.. code:: sh

   cd bowl1
   payu run

* Model will run in ``work/``

* Output saved to ``archive/``
